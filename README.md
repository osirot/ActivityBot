# ActivityBot
project for robotics using parallax Activity Bot


For a robotics course, my final project was to create a course for my Parallax Activity Bot, 
I named him “Jerry”. This required driving with precision, meaning one or both wheels of my 
bot had to stay on course at all time otherwise it is disqualified. 

Some tools I used included SimpleIDE and the “simpletools.h” library.
